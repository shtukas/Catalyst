Spots (are the new Requirements)

Spots: Array[SpotClaim]
SpotClaim: [spotname: String, objectuuid: String]

When an object can't be done right now because I am not at the right location or a condition is not met (for instance no internet connection), we issue a spot claim to postpone it. This replaces the "do not show until" DateTime.
