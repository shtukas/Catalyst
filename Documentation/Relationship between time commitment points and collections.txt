When we start a commitment point the commitment point may have a key called `uuids-for-generic-time-tracking`.
We start those uuids and turn out that this is how the collection end up being started. (Indeed "starting" a collection
only means to start those uuids at the GenericTimeTracking.)

The collection, when running, runs at a higher metric than the time point itself.

Then we stop the collection and follow by shutting the time commitment.

The time that is recorded against the collection itself is not used beyond small ordering.
