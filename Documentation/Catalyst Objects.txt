    "uuid"               : UUID
    "agent-uid"          : String
    "metric"             : Float
    "announce"           : String
    "commands"           : Array[String]
    "default-expression" : Null or String               #Â optional
    "is-running"         : Boolean                      # optional
    "commands-lambdas"   : Null or Map[String, Lambda]  # optional
}

When a command is issued by the user the following happens:
	1. If "commands-lambdas" is defined, we try and look up for a lambda to run.
	   Lambdas take one argument which is the object itself.
	2. Otherwise we send the object and the command to the Agent.
