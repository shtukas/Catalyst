    "uuid"               : UUID
    "agentuid"           : nil or String
    "prioritization"     : nil | standard | high | running # optional
    "announce"           : String
    "commands"           : Array[String]
    "defaultExpression"  : Null or String                      #Â optional
    "commandsLambdas"    : Null or Map[String, Lambda]         # optional
    "commandsShells"     : Null or Map[String, String]         # optional
}

When a command is issued by the user the following happens:

    1. "commandsLambdas" is looked at first. If "commandsLambdas" is defined and object["commandsLambdas"][command] is defined, then we run the associated lambda.

    2. Then we try "commandsShells". If "commandsShells" is defined and object["commandsShells"][command] is defined, then we run the associated shell command. (With great power comes great responsibility). This is the mechanism by which we allow external entities to provide Catalyst Objects

	3. Otherwise we send the object and the command to the Agent.
