Streams are implemented as sequences of StreamItem

StreamItem extends CatalystObject {
    uuid                     : UUID
    agentuid                 : "d2de3f8e-6cf2-46f6-b122-58b60b2a96f1"
    streamuuid               : UUID
    ordinal                  : Float
    metric                   : Float
    announce                 : String
    commands                 : Array[String]
    filename                 : String
    generic-content-item     : GenericContentItem
    run-data                 : nil | Array[StreamItemRunTimeData]
    filename                 : String # added by the extractor
    filepath                 : String # last known filepath # added by the extractor
}

StreamItemRunTimeData : [Unixtime, TimespanInSeconds]

Rules:
    1. The streams are processed as FIFO queues.
    2. The first three items are active.
    3. The others are ignored.
    4. When an item has been worked on more than one hour, it is pushed to position 5.
