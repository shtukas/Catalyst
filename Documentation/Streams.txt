We have the following streams
    - Right Now
    - Today Important
    - XStream

Streams are implemented as sequences of StreamItem

StreamItem {
    "uuid"                     : UUID
    "streamuuid"               : UUID
    "description"              : String # optional, when set overrides the computed description
    "filename"                 : String
    "generic-content-filename" : String
    "ordinal"                  : Float
    "run-status"               : nil | Unixtime # Unixtime is the time since it's running.
    "run-data"                 : nil | Array[StreamItemRunTimeData]
}

StreamItemRunTimeData : (Unixtime, TimespanInSeconds)

The streams are processed as FIFO queues.

The first three items are active.

The others are ignored.

When an item has been worked on more than few hours, it is pushed to position 5
