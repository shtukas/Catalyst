We have the following streams
    - Right Now
    - Today Important
    - XStream

Streams are implemented as sequences of StreamItem

StreamItem {
    "uuid"                     : UUID
    "streamName"               : "Right-Now", "Today-Important", "XStream"
    "filename"                 : String
    "generic-content-filename" : String
    "ordinal"                  : Float
    "ignore-until-datetime"    : nil | DateTime
    "run-status"               : nil | Unixtime # Unixtime is the time since it's running.
    "run-data"                 : nil | Array[StreamItemRunTimeData]
}

StreamItemRunTimeData : (Unixtime, TimespanInSeconds)

The streams are processed as FIFO queues.

All the items are `started` and either `stopped` or `completed`.

The first three items are active.

The others are ignored.

When an item has been worked on more than few hours, it is pushed to position 5

Any item can be postponed until to a given datetime.
