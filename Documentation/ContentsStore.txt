ContentStore provides the service of storing and serving contents. This is the replacement of the old "announce".

Contents are stored and retrieved against ids and the ContentStore also provides the services of transforming a contents to an announce as well as transforming a contents to a body (if relevant).

Internaly there is a mapping between a ContentStoreItemId and a hash of contents object. This choice ensures, that clients can resubmit the same contents (which will be the case of some agents) with no file created or modified.
