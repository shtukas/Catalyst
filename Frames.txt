Frames are data carriers. They allow Cubes to mutate.

The notion of frame family was introduced when I was working on introducing mutation of asteroids. Turns out that an asteroid can have more than one independant frames, but then we only want to show the latest version of a given one, hence the notion of a family. When we issue a replacement frame we replace the frames of the same family. 

When a frame is created we need to specifiy its family name, either randomly chosen or given since the newly created frames is meant to replace anybody of the same family.
