Nyx is the collection of the DataNetwork and the Roles.

The DataNetwork is made of Quarks, Cubes, Tags and Cliques and the Links between them.

Any object of the DataNetwork can have one or more Roles.

Roles: Data, Asteriod, Starship, Wave and OpenCycle

When a cube is created a role is set. Roles can be added and removed any time. If a role is destroyed, and the cube doesn't have any role left, the user is asked to set a role or to destroy the Cube.
