This repository contains two systems, one called **Catalyst** and the other one called **DocNet** (Multi-user Documentation Network). If you are coming from the Guardian, you are looking for DocNet ðŸ™‚

Some documentation, including prerequisites and installation procedures, about Catalyst can be found [here](documentation/Catalyst.md), and similar documentation about DocNet can be found [here](documentation/DocNet.md). 


Q: What exactly is the relationship betweeen Catalyst and DocNet ?

A: DocNet is simply a limited version of Catalyst. They share the exact same code, but when DocNet runs, some features are not enabled.


Q: What is the latest in terms of roadmap ?

A: As of July 2020, most of the effort is put in reorganizing Catalyst's data model (including migrating its existing data to the new model) and make DocNet multi-user. Also Catalyst and DocNet are going to be re-written in Go by the end of 2020.
