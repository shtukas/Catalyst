## Catalyst

Catalyst is a collection of independant systems collectively managing datasets and tasks that one accesses through a unified command line interface. It's used by Pascal both as an advanced electronic secretary and also his knowledge network.

### Origins

Catalyst [was born in 2016](http://blog.alseyn.net/index.php?uuid=16a853b0-18c1-46b7-a6bd-392b4df98e5e) as the web interface of my pre-existing todo list management tool.

One or two years before that I had played with [Nyx](http://blog.alseyn.net/index.php?uuid=40bd59d4-48de-454a-9a50-2c2a1c919e32), which was at the time my [Personal Information Management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management).

The current Catalyst is a command line tool which realises the functions of both the old Catalyst and Nyx together (they share the same unified underlying dataset).
