## Catalyst

Catalyst is a data management system. More exactly, a collection of independant systems which each manage different types of data and that one access through a unified interface.

Catalyst is very heavily used by Pascal to manage his digital assets and, in its current form, cannot be used by somebody else. 

### Origins

In the beginning there was Nyx, a command line tool and web interface used by Pascal as a [Personal Information Management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management). In 2015, I wrote a [detailed entry](http://blog.alseyn.net/index.php?uuid=40bd59d4-48de-454a-9a50-2c2a1c919e32) about what Nyx fundamentally is, and how it was built at the time. The first Catalyst (todo list management) [was born in 2016](http://blog.alseyn.net/index.php?uuid=16a853b0-18c1-46b7-a6bd-392b4df98e5e). 

The current Catalyst is now a long decendant and evolved version of the two above tools.
