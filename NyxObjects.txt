The Objects that go to the object store ( eg: `NyxObjects::put(object)` ), need to have the three following attributes

    - uuid                : String
    - nyxNxSet            : String
    - nyxNxStoreTimestamp : Float # Unixtime with decimals # set by the storage function itself

nyxNxSet null indicates that the object has been deleted.
