Special timelines are "[Inbox]", and "[Open Cycles]". 

[Inbox] is not actually declared by, say Vienna or Lucille-Inbox processing, but is the default timeline for any Lucille item without one. An item on that timeline is meant to either be immediately consumed (eg: online comics), or recast to the appropriate timeline.

[Open Cycles] is used to store material that may need to be looked up as part of an ongoing project.

Note that we also have [Infinity], which contains the streams of entertainement consumables.
