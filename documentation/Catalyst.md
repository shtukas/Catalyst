## Catalyst

Catalyst is both an advanced electronic secretary and a file system. 

### Origins

It started with [Nyx](http://blog.alseyn.net/index.php?uuid=40bd59d4-48de-454a-9a50-2c2a1c919e32), which was at the time Pascal's [Personal Information Management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management).

Then in early 2016, Catalyst [was born](http://blog.alseyn.net/index.php?uuid=16a853b0-18c1-46b7-a6bd-392b4df98e5e) as the web interface of a pre-existing todo list management tool.

The current Catalyst is a command line tool which fuses the functions of both Nyx and the old Catalyst.

### Prerequisites

```
$ gem install curses # or sudo gem install curses
```

### Run

To run Catalyst run 

```
./catalyst
```

at the command line. Note that Catalyst doesn't run outside `alexandra` (Pascal' computer).
