## DocNet

This is the home page of the DocNet end user documentation.

DocNet is a multi-user distributed documentation framework, built for the Guardian engineering department. DocNet became an active project mid 2020 and is a work in progress.

In this documentation:

- How to aquire it and get it to run.
- The basic functions 
	- Exploration of the knowledge network.
	- Creation and edition of new datapoints.

DocNet...

- Was born as a terminal application (a purposeful choice by its author, Pascal), but will acquire other interfaces as time goes on. 
- Is written in Ruby (because the program is a child of, Catalyst, is written in Ruby), but Catalyst (and therefore DocNet) is going to be rewritten in Go.
- Has an interesting data model. The reader is invited to get familiar with it to better understand the user interface. See [DocNet Datamodel](DocNetDatamodel.md).

### Installation and running

There is only one dependency that you might not already have installed: the `curses` gem.

```
$ gem install curses # or sudo gem install curses
```

DocNet is currently distributed as a github repo, so do clone the repository [https://github.com/shtukas/catalyst](https://github.com/shtukas/catalyst) and then 

```
./docnet
```

at the command line, and that's all. You should then be greeted with this screen.

Note that DocNet will store its data here: `~/.docnet`.
