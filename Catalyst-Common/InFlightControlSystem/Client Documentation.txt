As a client, generally an application, you need to use the management provided by InFlightControlSystem all you need to do is:

1. Register your element once. Use a targetuid specific to it.
    InFlightControlSystem::newItemInteractive(targetuid, description)

2. Make your object the most natural way, and transmute it with
    InFlightControlSystem::catalistItemIFCSTransmutation(targetuid, object)

3. Then you only need to start it and stop it.

    InFlightControlSystem::start(targetuid)
    InFlightControlSystem::stop(ltargetuid)

You do not need to manage the times, IFCS does that for you.
