Catalyst agents must have the following methods implemented

agentuuid(): String
    Returns the unique id of the agent. Should never change as it is hardcoded in the stored objects

getNewOrTransientObjects(dataSet): Array[object]
    Returns
        - new objects, or
        - objects which only exists in memory and do not have a presence in the DataLog.

processObject(object, command): Null | updated object | death object
    Return
        - Null if there was no update to the object (for instance, calling "folder")
        - An object with udpated fields
        - A death object (for instance, when the object is "done")
