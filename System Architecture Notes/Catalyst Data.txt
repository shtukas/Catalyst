Data in the Catalyst universe comes in 3 flavours:
    1. lines in Wave objects
    2. NGX15 references
    3. Quark/Lepton pairs

We refer to NGX15 and Quarks/Lepton collectively as Datapoints

We have a system of
    - Tags
    - OpsNodes
    - EncyclopediaNodes

for classification and search.

We refer to OpsNodes and EncyclopediaNodes as collectively as XNodes.

Asteroids and Waves are used to drive the main todo priority list.
