Data in the Catalyst universe comes in 3 flavours:
    1. lines in Wave objects
    2. NGX15 references
    3. Quark/Lepton pairs

We refer to NGX15 and Quarks/Lepton collectively as Datapoints

We have a system of
    - Tags
    - OperationalListings
    - EncyclopediaListings

for classification and search.

We refer to OperationalListings and EncyclopediaListings as collectively as Listings.

Asteroids and Waves are used to drive the main todo priority list.
