Arrows

Arrows provide network topology between NSCoreObjects, but are now not NSCoreObjects themselves.

They are currently stored in a SQLite database: Arrows.sqlite3

table: arrows
    _sourceuuid_    text
    _targetuuid_    text

create table arrows (_sourceuuid_ text, _targetuuid_ text);

Table was created once by hand.
