Islands are nodes of the knowledge graph. They are connected by links (not arrows). 

For the moment we will be enforcing that the names are unique. (If needed we can relax that requirement later)

Island {
    "uuid"     : UUID
    "nyxNxSet" : "287041db-39ac-464c-b557-2f172e721111"
    "unixtime" : Float # Unixtime with decimals
    "name"     : String
}
