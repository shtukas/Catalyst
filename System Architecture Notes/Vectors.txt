Vectors are used for general classification

Example: A picture of a funny cat could have the vector "root :: reddit :: funny" pointing at it which specifies where in the classification from root the datapoint is. ore than one vector can point at a given datapoint. This is how we realise the effect that a given point could be at more than one position in the file hierarchy.

Vector {
    "uuid"     : UUID
    "nyxNxSet" : "e54eefdf-53ea-47b0-a70c-c93d958bbe1c"
    "unixtime" : Float # Unixtime with decimals
    "sequence" : Array[String]
}
