The Nx50s are the Quarks that we list.

If the number of elements is less than 30, then a thread takes 20 random Quarks and transmute them to Nx50s.

Nx50 (same as Quark) (CoreDataTx) {
    uuid             : String   # _objectId_
    schema           : "Nx50"   # _schema_
    unixtime         : Float    # _unixtime_
    description      : String   # _description_

    contentType      : String   # _payload1_
    payload          : String   # _payload2_
}

- contentType : "Line" | "Url" | "Text" | "ClickableType" | "AionPoint"
- payload
    [contentType]     -> [payload]
    "Line"            -> "" # empty string, the description is the payload
    "Url"             -> String
    "Text"            -> String # reference to a blob
    "ClickableType"   -> <nhash>|<dottedExtension>
    "AionPoint"       -> <nhash>


The scheduling of Nx50s is a bit complex and relies on recovery times, but we can override the default by issuing 

Xcache/set: "172EB21E-FD80:#{uuid}", value

where value:
    "C337E066-5E21:#{RT commitment per day}" # stays up until we reach that target
