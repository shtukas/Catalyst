NGX15 locations are markers in the Galaxy file system. They are the "open" counterparts of the quarks datapoints. NGX15s are used when the files and folders need to be naturaly available on the standard file system.

The locations (files or directories) are identified by the fact that they are named NGX15-Identifier(possible suffix). We call the "NGX15-Identifier" part a code. The code is what is stored in a nyx NGX15 object. any file or folder with a name that start with the code is recognised as the target of the object. The reason why we use codes and not filenames is to allow directory "NGX15-caedde8d-6136-4ead-9279-58f8be14f3fd" to become file "NGX15-caedde8d-6136-4ead-9279-58f8be14f3fd.txt" without updating the object itself.

There is a special case of NGX15 directory that was introduced for the case of learning cycles, where the structure of the folder acts as a recursive todo list. If all the elements of the folders start with X followed by two digits, for instance X12, then every element is seen as list item, recursively. The toString and access of those special folders is different to that of standard NGX15s. The supporting code is found in NGX15_Extended1.
