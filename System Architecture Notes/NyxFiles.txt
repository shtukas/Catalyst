A NyxFile is any file on disk that has a name of the form NyxFile-<UUID>.<extension>, for instance: NyxFile-fcb5541a-6e2e-48dd-9981-2f137fe8490c.txt

Note: 
    - Unlike what it might have been for unique names, the random fragment of a NyxFile must be a uuid. Ideally they should be generated by catalyst itself.
    - Only the NyxFile-<UUID> fragment is stored in the datapoint
